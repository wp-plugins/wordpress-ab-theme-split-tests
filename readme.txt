Split test your wordpress theme, and track test using Google Analytics user defined values.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you set up two different templates with differences that you think might increase conversions, serve these different templates up to users, and track their activity using custom segments in Google Analytics.

== Installation ==

*You Must* already be tracking visitors through Google Analytics - if you don't already do this, then we recommend the [Google Analytics For Wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) which we know works with this plugin - although any other Google Analytics plugins should also work.

1. Upload the Plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set up different themes to test
4. Choose the themes to test in the Plugin settings (Settings &raquo; SES Theme Split Test in the Wordpress admin area)
5. Set up custom segments in Google Analytics

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't this the same as Google Website Optimizer? =

No - this lets you split test whole themes rather than content changes, e.g. navigation on the let versus navigation on the right
